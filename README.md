domvm (DOM ViewModel)
---------------------
A thin, fast, dependency-free vdom view layer _(MIT Licensed)_

---
### Intro

domvm is a flexible, pure-js view layer for your web apps.

- It's small: [~5k gz](/dist/README.md), fast: [just 10%](https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts/table.html) slower vs ideal vanilla DOM code, zero-dependency and tooling-free.
- Its entire API can be mastered in under 1 hour by both, OO graybeards and FRP hipsters. Obvious, explicit behavior, debuggable plain JS templates, optional statefulness and interchangable imperative/declarative components.
- It'll happily fit into any existing codebase - whatever the structure.
- It's well-suited for building [simple widgets](https://rawgit.com/leeoniya/domvm/2.x-dev/demos/calendar.html) and [complex, fault-tolerant applications](http://rawgit.com/leeoniya/domvm/2.x-dev/demos/ThreaditJS/index.html).

But beware, domvm will not hold your hand nor will it force your hand; it lets you - not the view layer - dictate your app architecture.
It makes no attempt to cater to DOM or JavaScript novices; your ability to write your app in plain JS and raw DOM is assumed.

### What's Missing?

As a view layer, domvm does not include some things you would find in a larger framework.
This gives you the freedom to choose libs you already know or prefer for common tasks.
domvm provides a small, common surface for integration of routers, streams and immutable libs.
Some minimalist libs that work well:

- Routing: [domvm-router](https://github.com/leeoniya/domvm-router), [riot/route](https://github.com/riot/route), [rlite](https://github.com/chrisdavies/rlite), [navigo](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo)
- Ajax/fetch/XHR: [xr](https://github.com/radiosilence/xr), [alite](https://github.com/chrisdavies/alite)
- Streams: [flyd](https://github.com/paldepind/flyd), [xstream](https://github.com/staltz/xstream)
- Immutabile Stores: [Freezer](https://github.com/arqex/freezer), [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)

Many [/demos](/demos) are examples of how to use these libs in your apps.

### Builds

domvm comes in [several builds](/dist) of increasing size and features. The `nano` build is a good starting point and is sufficient for most cases.

---
### Installation

**Browser**

```html
<script src="dist/nano/domvm.nano.min.js"></script>
```

**Node**

```js
var domvm = require("domvm");   // the "full" build
```

---
### Templates

Most of your domvm code will consist of templates for creating virtual-dom trees, which in turn are used to render and redraw the DOM.
domvm exposes several factory functions to get this done. Commonly this is called [hyperscript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript).

For convenience, we'll alias each factory function with a short variable:

```js
var el = domvm.defineElement,
    tx = domvm.defineText,
    cm = domvm.defineComment,
    sv = domvm.defineSvgElement,
    vw = domvm.defineView,
    iv = domvm.injectView,
    ie = domvm.injectElement;
```

<!-- TODO
domvm.defineElementSpread
domvm.defineFragment
-->

Using `defineText` isn't strictly necessary since all encountered numbers and strings will be automatically converted into `defineText` vnodes for you.
Additionally, there's a convenience factory `domvm.h` that can discern `defineElement`, `defineView`, `injectView` and `injectElement` based on the provided arguments.

Below is a dense reference of most template semantics. Pay attention, there's a lot of neat stuff in here that won't be covered later!

```js
el("p", "Hello")                                            // plain tags
el("textarea[rows=10]#foo.bar.baz", "Hello")                // attr, id & class shorthands
el(".kitty", "Hello")                                       // "div" can be omitted from tags

el("input",  {type: "checkbox",    checked: true})          // boolean attrs
el("input",  {type: "checkbox", ".checked": true})          // set property instead of attr

el("button", {onclick: myFn}, "Hello")                      // event handlers
el("button", {onclick: [myFn, arg1, arg2]}, "Hello")        // parameterized
el("ul",     {onclick: {".item": myFn}}, ...)               // delegated
el("ul",     {onclick: {".item": [myFn, arg1, arg2]}}, ...) // delegated & parameterized

el("p",      {style: "font-size: 10pt;"}, "Hello")          // style can be a string
el("p",      {style: {fontSize: "10pt"}}, "Hello")          // or an object (camelCase only)
el("div",    {style: {width: 35}},        "Hello")          // "px" will be added when needed

el("h1", [                                                  // attrs object is optional
    el("em", "Important!"),
    "foo", 123,                                             // plain values
    ie(myElement),                                          // inject existing DOM nodes
    el("br"),                                               // void tags without content
    "", [], null, undefined, false,                         // these will be auto-removed
    NaN, true, {}, Infinity,                                // these will be coerced to strings
    [                                                       // nested arrays will get flattened
        el(".foo", {class: "bar"}, [                        // short & attr class get merged: .foo.bar
            "Baz",
            el("hr"),
        ])
    ],
])

el("#ui", [
    vw(NavBarView, navbar),                                 // sub-view w/model
    vw(PanelView, panel, "panelA"),                         // sub-view w/model & key
    iv(someOtherView),                                      // injected external ViewModel
])

// special _* props

el("p", {_raw: true}, "<span>A am text!</span>")            // raw innerHTML body, CAREFUL!
el("p", {_key: "myParag"}, "Some text")                     // keyed nodes
el("p", {_data: {foo: 123}}, "Some text")                   // per-node data (faster than attr)

el("p", {_ref: "myParag"}, "Some text")                     // named refs (vm.refs.myParag)
el("p", {_ref: "pets.james"}, "Some text")                  // namespaced (vm.refs.pets.james)
```

### Views

What React calls "components", domvm calls "views".
A view definition is a named function which gives you an isolated working scope for any internal view state or helper functions.
This function must return a template-generating `render` function or an object containing the same:

<!--
However, domvm's views can be initialized both imperatively and declaratively prior to being composed within other views or being rendered to the DOM.
This opens the door to much more interesting architectural patterns when needed, without resorting to non-idiomatic framework hacks.
-->

```js
var el = domvm.defineElement;

function MyView() {                                         // named view closure
    return function() {                                         // render()
        return el("div", "Hello World!");                           // template
    };
}

function YourView() {
    return {
        render: function() {
            return el("div", "Hello World!");
        }
    };
}
```

Object-oriented folks may prefer ES6 class-based views. Simply include the ViewModel class wrapper.

```html
<script src="src/view/addons/ViewClass.js"></script>
```
```js
var el = domvm.defineElement;

class MyView extends View {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.state = {i: 0};                                // this === vm
    }

    render() {
        return el("div", "Hello World! " + this.state.i);
    }
}

var vm = new MyView();

// or...

var vm = domvm.createView(MyView);
```

See [/demos/es6-class-views.html](/demos/es6-class-views.html) for more details.


Views can accept an external `model` to render (often referred to as `external state`, `data` or React's `props`):

```js
function MyView(vm, model, key, opts) {
    return function(vm, model, key, opts) {
        return el("div", "Hello " + model.firstName + "!");
    };
}
```

Here, `vm` is this views's `ViewModel`; it's the created instance of `MyView` and serves the same purpose as `this` within an ES6 React component.
The `vm` provides the control surface/API to this view and can also expose a user-defined API for external view manipulation.
`render` has the same signature as the view closure (more on "why" later).

<!--
Why does `render` have the same signature as the view closure?
In pure stateless views or ones with immutability, `render`'s arguments may change between redraws while the closure's arguments are fixated once at initialization.
If your view is stateful and permanently bound to a single model (more on this later), the closure's arguments can be used, otherwise they may become stale.
Which arguments are appropriate to use can be decided on a view-by-view basis and will depend on how the data/model is expected to flow into each view.
Relying on `render`'s args is similar to React's functional components, while using the closure's args is similar to using React's ES6 class components.
-->

Rendering a view to the DOM is called mounting. To mount a top-level view, we create it from a view definition:

```js
var model = {
    firstName: "Leon"
};

var vm = domvm.createView(MyView, model);

vm.mount(document.body);            // appends into target
```

By default, `.mount(container)` will append the view into the container. Alternatively, to replace an existing placeholder element:

```js
var placeholder = document.getElementById("widget");

vm.mount(placeholder, true);        // replaces placeholder
```

When a model mutates, you can request to redraw the view, optionally passing a boolean `sync` flag to force a synchronous redraw.

```js
vm.redraw(sync);
```

If you need to *replace* a view's model (as with immutable data structures), you can use `vm.update`, which will also redraw.
If replacing a model, make sure you do not internally use the `model` passed to the view closure, since this cannot be changed.
Instead, use the `model` argument provided to `render(vm, model, key)` or `vm.model` which will be replaced as needed.

```js
vm.update(newModel, sync);
```

Of course, you can nest views. This can be done either declaratively or via injection of any already-initialized view:

```js
function ViewA(vm, model) {
    return function() {
        return el("div", [
            el("strong", modelA.test),
            vw(ViewB, modelA.modelB),               // implicit/declarative view
            iv(model.viewC),                        // injected explicit view
        ]),
    };
}

function ViewB(vm, model) {
    return function() {
        return el("em", model.test2);
    };
}

function ViewC(vm, model) {
    return function() {
        return el("em", model.test3);
    };
}

var modelC = {
    test3: 789,
};

var modelA = {
    test: 123,
    modelB: {
        test2: 456,
    },
    viewC: domvm.createView(ViewC, modelC),
};

var vmA = domvm.createView(ViewA, modelA).mount(document.body);
```

### Hello World++

**Try it:** https://jsfiddle.net/csLa6bew/

```js
var el = domvm.defineElement;                       // element VNode creator

function StepperView(vm, stepper) {                 // view closure (called once during init)
    function add(num) {
        stepper.value += num;
        vm.redraw();
    }

    function set(e) {
        stepper.value = +e.target.value;
    }

    return function() {                             // template renderer (called on each redraw)
        return el("#stepper", [
            el("button", {onclick: [add, -1]}, "-"),
            el("input[type=number]", {value: stepper.value, oninput: set}),
            el("button", {onclick: [add, +1]}, "+"),
        ]);
    };
}

var stepper = {                                     // some external model/data/state
    value: 1
};

var vm = domvm.createView(StepperView, stepper);    // create ViewModel, passing model

vm.mount(document.body);                            // mount into document
```

The above example is simple and decoupled. It provides a UI to modify our stepper object which itself needs no awareness of any visual representation.
But what if we want to modify the stepper using an API and still have the UI reflect these changes. For this we need to add some coupling.
One way to accomplish this is to beef up our stepper with an API and give it awareness of its view(s) which it will redraw.
The end result is a lightly-coupled domain model that:

1. Holds state, as needed.
2. Exposes an API that can be used programmatically and is UI-consistent.
3. Exposes view(s) which utilize the API and can be composed within other views.

It is *this* fully capable, view-augmented domain model that domvm's author considers a truely reusable "component".

**Try it:** https://jsfiddle.net/qgyu1g36/

```js
var el = domvm.defineElement;

function StepperView(vm, stepper) {
    var add = stepper.add.bind(stepper);

    function set(e) {
        stepper.set(e.target.value);
    }

    return function() {
        return el("#stepper", [
            el("button", {onclick: [add, -1]}, "-"),
            el("input[type=number]", {value: stepper.value, oninput: set}),
            el("button", {onclick: [add, +1]}, "+"),
        ]);
    };
}

function Stepper() {
    this.value = 1;

    this.add = function(num) {
        this.value += num;
        this.view.redraw();
    };

    this.set = function(num) {
        this.value = +num;
        this.view.redraw();
    };

    this.view = domvm.createView(StepperView, this);
}

var stepper = new Stepper();

stepper.view.mount(document.body);

// now let's use the stepper's API to increment
var i = 0;
var it = setInterval(function() {
    stepper.add(1);

    if (i++ == 20) clearInterval(it);
}, 250);
```

### Lifecycle Hooks

**Demo:** [lifecycle-hooks](https://rawgit.com/leeoniya/domvm/2.x-dev/demos/lifecycle-hooks.html) different hooks animate in/out with different colors.

**Node-level**

Usage: `el("div", {_hooks: {...}}, "Hello")`

- will/didInsert (initial insert)
- will/didRecycle (reuse & patch)
- will/didReinsert (detach & move)
- will/didRemove

Node-level `will*` hooks allow a promise/thennable return and can delay the event until the promise is resolved, allowing you to CSS animate, etc.

**View-level**

Usage: `vm.hook({willMount: ...})` or `return {render: ..., hooks: {willMount: ...}}`

- will/didRedraw
- will/didMount
- will/didUnmount

View-level `will*` hooks are not yet promise handling, so cannot be used for delay, but you can just rely on the view's root node's hooks to accomplish similar goals.
